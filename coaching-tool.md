A coaching tool needs to have the following 5 things:

1. Frictionless on-boarding which captures:
  + existing behaviour
  + future goals
  + any emotional reasons for unhealthy habits

2. Guide the user to establish "SMART" goals
e.g: "Next time I visit a venue that sells alcoholic drinks,
I will request/try a non-alcoholic version of my favourite drink."
**S**pecific
**M**easureable
**A**chieveable
**R**elevant
**T**imely

> _**Note**: if we prefer to use an alternative goal-setting framework,
we will incorporate that into the app with relative ease.
This is just a starting point_.

3. Frictionless Capture:
Make tracking their behaviour/consumption as easy as possible; 2 taps.

When the user opens the PWA the "home screen" should be "add item"
in "FasTrack" it will allow the user to add any food item.
For the CS-Coach it will be restricted to Drinks.
This is merely a change in focus for the product type.
So instead of having different types of pictures
e.g: Drinks, Fruit, Snack, Sandwich, Salad, Meal,
It the iconography would be _types_ of drinks:
e.g: Pint Glass, Bottle, Wine Glass, Soda Glass.

> **A.I Opportunity**:
prioritise the user's personal favourite drinks
in the menu such that they don't have to scroll
in order to capture their consumed items.

4. Positive Feedback Loop:
When the user enters a drink, congratulate them on their choice
if it meets their Goal. If the App has any _previous_ data,
share it in the form of an insight.
e.g: "Last week you had 4 drinks and felt great!
Why not stick to 3 this week and see you how feel?"

> **A.I Opportunity**:
Dependent on the amount of data in the system,
we can give statistically-significant insights to users
e.g: "87% of people report feeling better the next day
if they stick to 1 drink. Share this with your friends
so they know why you have decided to drink less."

5. Group Accountability

(_Optionally_) Sharing your goals with family/friends
so they can _help_ you achieve them
and not "lead you astray".
