# Why?

In Peter Thiel’s book,
**Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future**,
he asks this "contrarian question":

## "_What important truth do very few people agree with you on?_" ~ Peter Thiel

> We _highly recommend_ reading the book
as it will make you _think_
and encourage you
to _question_ your own _assumptions_ & _biases_.

This document is our _answer_ to the [question](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/231#issuecomment-419693586).
In short we feel that:

## 1. _Most_ **education** is _fundamentally_ "broken".

Teachers in ***most*** primary, middle and high **schools**
are forced to "_**teach** to the **test**_".
This means there is a highly prescriptive decades-old learning program
and deviation from the "national curriculum" is _punished_.

Conventional wisdom about education has not caught up with
recent research evidence on cultivating curiosity, motivation
and self-directed collaborative learning.

Contrary to the notion of "_no child left behind_",
having a one-size-fits-all education system
_automatically_ leaves many children "behind".
If a child does not _understand_ a particular foundational
topic in mathematics, they will _suffer_ for the _rest_
of their school years and _feel_ "stupid" in Science class.
This means students _often_ feel they "can't do science"
(_including computer science_).

Schools destroy childrens' curiosity.
And some people _never_ re-gain it.
see:
https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity

**University** is a unashamedly elitist
darwinian (""survival of the fittest") system
that forces people to conform to a strict "type"
and adhere to a narrow definition of "success"
or be considered a "failure" by their peers and/or society.

Instead of allowing people to be _curious_ and gain
a broad range of knowledge and experience,
people are forced to select a _tiny_ subset
of subjects to specialise in.
Want to study something that isn't an "_official_" program? Tough! Pick something from the "menu"
or go somewhere else.

> Note: if the University/College speciality is Medicine,
Civil Engineering or Physics (_for example_),
there is _usually_ "_enough_"
for the student to focus on,
but there are many degrees/subjects
where the student has more than enough time to learn other skills,
and yet often the University/College does not _allow_ them to!

We believe there is a _much_ better way
to learn collaboratively,
track your progress (_without stigma_)
and have something clear + _practical_
to _show_ others
as an _objective_ measure of your skill/experience.
<br />

Our proposed _answer_ to this problem:

1.a **_All_ learning materials** should
be ***free*** to the individual learning
to ensure that there is no "_barrier to entry_"
to the _highest_ quality learning.
This means people with fewer means (_no rich parents_)
don't have to get into absurd debt in order to learn
life-changing skills.
It also means that people who will _truly_ appreciate
the opportunity to do meaningful and well-compensated
work will _get_ the opportunity. Instead of the _current_
status quo where the tech industry is _dominated_
by people from affluent backgrounds.

> Note: we are not proposing infringing on anyone _else's_
copyright. If people chose to _charge_ for their materials,
they every right to do so, especially if it means
they cover their costs and can continue to produce
good content. We want to create all our _own_ materials
_from scratch_ to be unencumbered by "big publishing co."
draconian/obsolete intellectual property rules.
> This is not a "pipe dream", we already have a "bank"
of examples: https://github.com/dwyl?q=learn
to date we have written over a thousand pages of
instructional material. If it were published as a "book"
it would be a "door stop"!
We intend to make each lesson "byte sized" and
allow people to track their progress in a user-friendly way.

## 2. Comparing relative skill/experience levels is _hard_.

It has _historically_ been
quite difficult to _measure_ relative skill level
both among prospective people joining a team
and _existing_ team members.

> e.g: If someone says they have "JavaScript experience",
what does that _actually_ mean?
Are they a core contributor on the Chromium Dev team,
or have they copy-pasted snippets from StackOverflow?
Most "recruiters" or "HR" people have **no idea**
how to spot the difference
between someone who has honed "deep skills"
and experience vs. someone who just left a "bootcamp".
To most recruiters it's all "keywords",
they don't have a clue about the difference between
Java and JavaScript; and worse, they don't want to learn!
This means the "quality" of "candidates" varies _considerably_
and comparing people is "apples vs. oranges".
Or in some cases
["lemons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons).
Is someone who has
[**10 thousand hours**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNX-g8TMyyY)
of _diligent deliberate practice_
and world class fortune 500 experience
a "better" choice for your mission critical system
than the person who built "tick-tac-toe"
using the "create react app" at XYZ coding bootcamp?
Yes, this is an extreme dichotomy,
but most recruiters/HR simply don't care!
They have a "Job Spec" with a few keywords,
and they will match as many as they can to the
"skills" the person has listed on their CV/LinkedIn,
with no regard to **demonstrable** real world experience.
What does "2 years" of Node.js actually mean?!
We need to make it clear that not having "10 years" experience
doesn't mean the person is "worse" they just need
to focus their deliberate practice on specific skills
and acquire knowledge/skills systematically.

2.a The answer to this problem is simple: Blockchain for Learning.
A _verifiable_ ledger of everything someone has learned in a subject
from "Hello world" to debugging a Linux kernel panic
on a inaccessible/remote embedded device to understand why
a mission critical IoT system is failing.
We have to "start somewhere"; we feel the best place to start
is with sharing the knowledge we _already_ have.
See details below in "Collaborative Learning Community".

## 3. **Asking questions** online while learning is _frustrating_!

Asking questions is a source stress and frustration in many "forums"
or question/answer sites where beginners often feel _unwelcome_.

If you have ever used online question/answer forums
you will have had one of two experiences:

a. You and your question were welcome and you got positive feedback
and an insightful answer that allowed you to continue on your quest.

b. You felt _unwelcome_, your question was ignored
or even ridiculed by "_trolls_".
Something along the lines of: "did you even Google that?"

This is a _widely_ known issue in the tech community.
The most popular Q/A site has _tried_ to address it,
but the fact remains that for _beginners_
most of the Q/A sites
are simply unwelcoming
and they end up using them as "read-only resources".

Ask a group of 100 beginners (_which luckily, we have access to_),
how many of them have posted a question online in the last week.

Fewer than half the hands will go up.
It's not because they didn't get "stuck" or _have_ the question(s)
they _could_ ask, they just didn't feel like they _should_ ask it!

This is a _fundamental flaw_ in the "system" that starts
in _primary_ school. When little _Alex_ asks a question
that shows their lack of understanding of something the teacher
has already covered and some kids in the class _laugh_,
it sends a clear signal to Alex that asking questions is
"rewarded" (_punished_) with ridicule.
So Alex stops asking questions ... and either suffers in silence
feeling like they are "thick", or makes extra effort to
discover the answers by themself in silence.
Most of the time, kids fall behind and "regress to the mean".
This where the problem starts. This is where we need to address it.

3.a The answer to this is pretty simple;
at least in _theory_.

+ The importance of asking questions in ***public***
as a learning exercise that benefits both the initial learner,
the mentor (_who answers the question_) and the wider community
should be _emphasised_ from the very beginning of learning.
  + If people don't _understand_ this or they are a "afraid" of asking
  questions because of "bad experiences", we must make it clear to _everyone_
  that @dwyl's online collaborative learning community is a "safe space"
  where anyone can ask the most _basic_ questions without _fear_ of
  being chastised by impatient peers
  or ridiculed by emotionally insecure internet trolls
  living in their mom's basement!
+ People should be encouraged to ask their _first_ question
the _first_ time they get "stuck".
+ If the auto-complete finds a similar question to what they are
asking, we should still encourage them to post the question.
Even if the answer is simply a link/redirect to the existing Q/A.
+ Questions should _never_ be marked as "off topic",
they should simply be _categorised_ according to the _relevant_ topic.
+ People should receive _immediate_ positive
feedback/reinforcement when they ask a question!
+ A tally of the questions they ask should be kept as a "karma score".


## 4. Creative technology work is "_unevenly distributed_" by "gatekeepers"

Creative tech work is unfairly distributed
to people with skills/experience by a handful of "gatekeepers"
who control as much as they can to _extract_ value
they aren't _creating_.
Middle-men (_and, yes it is mostly men!_) still rule the sector.

**4.a** We intend to have a skills & experience based network
where anyone can _easily_ see the _portfolio_ of anyone else in the NetWork
and can determine if the person is a good fit for their project.

Profiles will be anonymised in search results
so discrimination will _hopefully_ be avoided.


5. Most people don't realise that sharing their knowledge,
multiplies the value they both create and _capture_!



6. People who don't cope well with interviews and arbitrary
"coding ability tests" are excluded from the job market.




# What?

## Collaborative Learning Community (CLC)

Our _starting_ point for "Phase 1.0" of **@dwyl**
is building a learning community (platform) where
_anyone_ can learn how to build web/mobile Apps.

If people ask "_why this stack_?" or "_why not xyz_?" we can
point them to the
[github.com/dwyl/**technology-stack**](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack)
repo where this is explained.
(_and if they have any **further questions**
  they are encouraged to_
  [***open issues***](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues))

Our stack will be the most _productive_, _robust_ and _fast_
Open Source realtime web stack.
It will rival or _eclipse_ Meteor.js for "wow factor"
when building apps that "just work" and are _fast_.
_Faster_ than any other "bootcamp" or "academy"
(_i.e. Node.js, Ruby-on-Rails or Django, etc_).

Our learning materials will ***always*** be **free** for _personal_
and _non commercial_ use.
(_e.g schools, universities, charities & non-profits_)

### Companies Can _Pay_ for Learning Platform Access

If a **_for profit_ company**
wants to use the learning platform,
to "up-skill" their employees
they must pay per user.
e.g: €99/user/year up-front. (£8.25/user/month)

For the up-front payment, they will receive
an _internal_ (_branded_) learning network,
where any employee can ask _project-specific_
questions in _private_.

All code snippets and links to internal projects will remain private/secured
and on a _separate_ logical server to the _public_ learning community.
e.g: companyname.dwyl.com

The _default_ for _general learning_ questions will still be **`public`**,
because getting "_more eyes_" on the question will result in
faster and more diverse answers.

Companies that don't _understand_ that encouraging your people
to _actively_ learn on the job, will not _understand_ our platform/community.

If companies _prefer_ to **pay monthly**, e.g: so they don't have to
get a "_purchase order_" and can just "_expense it_",
we will have a monthly plan.

We _prefer_ to give people a "free trial" until they are "_ready to pay_".
That way the companies/teams can determine the _value_ for themselves
_before_ they have to pay, and we can have a _threshold_ of "_utility_",
_before_ we encourage them to pay.

> In order to facilitate _internal_ vs. public learning networks,
we should build our system with _multi-tennency_ in mind.
This means _auth_ (_roles and permissions_) should be central,
and then sessions are stateless and distributed. i.e. "single sign-on".
(_not the crap that Slack pulls
where you have to login to each community separately!_)

The benefit to the **company** is:
+ they can easily keep track of their team members progress.
+ they get an _internal_ "learning leaderboard" useful for promotion decisions.
+ they can _chose_ to make their employee's questions
and profile _private_ on the ***public*** forum.
Thus avoiding recruiters from poaching their best people.
(_we will **strongly advise against this** as the "teams" feature
will help **prospective employees** find a team they **want** to join!_)


If the company has more than 20 employees,
we can put together a "learning kickstart training package"
which includes (on-site or off-site) **in-person training**
with "***experienced practitioners***".
(_the **experts** will be people in the NetWork
  who have used the skills to build **multiple projects**
  and have **proven track record**.
  Not inexperienced amateurs who know the skills in theory,
  but will **waste** the **time** of the **learners**
  which is **far more expensive** because **ineffective habits & poor skills**
  are transmitted by people who don't have the production experience!_)



# NetWork

There is no "NetWork" until we achieve a critical mass of learners.
Once we have a few hundred people learning in the community, we can
start to address some of the more challenging questions.
Thankfully, it will not be very _difficult_ to reach the
number of people where a "NetWork" starts to make sense.


This is a high-level "bullet points" list

+ All Learning Materials, Questions & Answers are _always_ viewable
without registration and licensed as creative commons (_non-commercial_).
+ Karma points are gained for asking & answering questions.
(_SO far, SO familiar_...)
+ Karma points are _also_ gained when people _upvote_ other people's answers!
  i.e. if you _give_ praise, you _get_ points!!
+ Questions and answers can be ***anonymous*** or named
(_author/answer's choice_).
+ Registration is required to post a question, answer and up-vote.
+ To build a diverse and inclusive community, there should be:
  + No "penalty" for asking questions, _ever_. (_Down-voting is just bad!_)
  + Everyone is _always_ welcome regardless of skill/knowledge.
+ Autocompletion/autosuggestion needs to be _great_ for avoiding duplicates.
+ Duplicates are not a "_problem_" if there are _subtle_ differences in the Q/A.
  + The more questions we have (_even very similar ones_) the more "findable"
  the answers become.
+ Questions/Answers should be linked to learning materials.
  + it should be clear at which point in the learning material
  the question was raised. So the Q/A _contextual_.
  + Wherever possible questions/answers should be self-contained
  and thus generally applicable. But if the question is _specific_
  to the learning material in question, that's fine too,
  because it enhances the learning!

+ The code for the entire platform is _always_ Open Source,
so _anyone_ can fork, run and (_hopefully_) _contribute_ to improving it!
  + The _value_ in the platform is the _network_ not the _code_.
+ Register to track your progress and have an autogenerated "Skills List".
+ Skills list is your "CV" and will be the source of your work in the NetWork.
+ We pay members of the NetWork _up-front_ to create learning materials.
+ _Additionally_ creators get a revenue share of membership fees
based on the popularity of their learning materials.
+ No "full time teachers": if you aren't doing the _work_
you don't have the _practical_ experience to teach the material.
