# _Why_? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Having a _clear_ **Product Roadmap** is ***essential***
to help ***everyone*** _focus_
on our _collective **goal**_.

> **Note**: this document is a
["work-in-progress"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/work_in_progress#Noun),
it's _definitely_ not "finished". <br />
A _good_ product roadmap evolves over time
in response to _feedback_;
by definition it's _never_ "complete". <br />
What you are reading is a _snapshot_
of the roadmap as it is _right now_.
If you ‚≠ê (bookmark) the repo 
and return to it in future, it will _definitely_ be different
because we update it fairly regularly.
We use a Git repo so that we (_and anyone `else` in the community_)
can _track_ the changes/evolution as we 
[Learn, Build and Measure](http://theleanstartup.com/principles). <br />
We welcome any/all feedback on it 
_especially_ from people who are `new`
to the 
[`@dwyl`](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here#who) 
community. <br />
Please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/issues)
if you have any ideas/questions.
Thanks! ‚ú® <br />

## _Why_ Are We Building An _App_?

If there was an _existing_ 
(Open Source Cross-platform Real-time Collaborative) 
system 
that allowed us to achieve _everything_ we have in mind for the dwyl App,
we would _use_ it without hesitation.
Sadly, we have not found any platform 
that has a
[_systematic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System), 
[goal oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_orientation)
and 
[collaborative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration)
way to _effectively_ let individuals and/or teams:

1. **Set** **goals** that are ["SMART"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
either freeform or using the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) framework.

2. **Capture** everything on one's mind 
as (plaintext) `items`, (voice) `recordings` or `images`
to declutter thoughts 
and think more clearly/creatively

3. **Categorise** the `items` into logical categories using `tags`
(_ideally linked to specific goals_).

4. **Transform** `items` of text into _actionable_ `items` 
such as: 
"Task" (_with context, deadline, progress, dependencies, etc._), 
"Reminder", 
"Calendar" (_Meeting, Date, Event, Travel, etc._), 
"Ingredient" (Shopping list `item`), etc. 
We want _complete_ versatility in the `tags` that can be applied to items
so that our App can be used for _any_ purpose that helps people organise their lives.

5. **Track** tasks and goal progress **_visually_**.

6. **Communicate** with others what task we are focussing on
so we can all avoid interrupting/distracting each other during 
["Deep Work"](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work)
Avoiding the "what you doing" type questions,
or general interruptions is essential for focus work.

7. **Delegate** specific tasks 
to people in one's family/team/org
with built-in tracking to _eliminate_
["status update requests"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_work)

There are _plenty_ of "productivity" apps 
that _partially_ solve these problems.
_Most_ of the Apps you/we can list are Closed Source,
which rules them out (for us) 
for the reasons described in "Why Open Source?" (_below_).
We have _scoured_ GitHub/GitLab/etc. to find an Open Source App/system
we can use and nothing comes _close_ to solving the problem.
We have _extensively studied_ the 
UI/UX 
of the Closed Source Apps 
see: https://github.com/dwyl/product-ux-research/issues
and _none_ of them have the workflow (UX) we want
or they focus on the wrong things!

[![notion-encourages-busywork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/85288902-75077480-b48e-11ea-8b41-75299936985b.png)](https://github.com/dwyl/product-ux-research/issues/5#issuecomment-647495254 "Notion encourages busy-work - Click to read")

We want to help people focus on the _one_ `task` 
they need to be doing _right now_,
and easily hide/show the rest when needed.
We want to apply both the science and art of distraction-free focus
we have read about in books such as 
"Deep Work",
"Indistractable", 
"Digital Minimalism",
"Make Time",
"Tools of Titans",
"Hyperfocus"
and _many_ others.
The fact is this:
_none_ of the _existing_ closed source Apps 
help you to _prioritise_ and _focus_
on your highest value/impact `items`. 
We are _fixing_ that!

<br />

# _What_?

<!--
In "Phase One" of dwyl we are building
a software application to solve a _specific_ set
of ***7 Universal Human Needs***:

1. **Communication**
2. **_Personal_ Effectiveness** through **Task and Time Management**
3. **Teamwork**
4. [***Self-Actualisation***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization)

Later, once we have an _excellent_ UX for our core app,
we will strategically expand our app
to cover other areas including:
4. **Life-long Learning**
5. **Nutrition, Health and Fitness**
6. **Personal Finance Management**

> _**Note**: we don't expect a **single** app to magically "**solve**"
all of these problems, and we are **not** going
to "tackle" all the problems at **once**;
we may end up only having time/resources to solve **one**
of these challenges.
This list is intended as a guide not a "gospel"._
-->

dwyl's
[mission](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/6fac8f0e4b9a81cba929eb7e577f22a4a0eb734c/mission.md#what-is-dwyls-mission) 
is to:

## _Empower people to maximise effectiveness, creativity and happiness._


Few people know more about effectiveness 
than life coach and motivational speaker 
[Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins). <br />
A quote of his that guides us in our mission is:

## "_The secret to happiness is one word: progress. <br />Progress equals happiness._" [Tony Robbins](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/06/tony-robbins-this-is-the-secret-to-happiness-in-one-word.html)


We believe that by helping people 
_effectively_ keep track 
of their progress 
toward their goals, <br />
they will naturally be happier. 
Happiness is almost a _byproduct_ of personal effectiveness!

## "_Happiness is not something ready made. <br />It comes from your own actions._" ~ [Dalai Lama](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1263-happines)

By helping people to focus their efforts
on their highest priority items,
we are helping people be _happy_. <br />
That's a mission we can _all_ get on board with!


Our immediate plan is to build a **_single_ app**
that satisfies _several_ human needs
while focussing on the theme of "***personal effectiveness***".


The @dwyl App will be a "_hybrid_"
containing several features
that together help the individual
achieve _all_ of their personal goals
through a systematic workflow.

<br />

## _What Problem_ Are We _Solving_?

We are building an App that 
creates a systematic approach 
to solve the problem we _all_ face every day. <br />
What do you think of when you 
see/read/hear/think of 
the following words:


## "_I don't have enough time to_..."

How many times have you heard 
a friend, family member or work colleague 
say these words?

> "I don't have enough time to:" <br />
> 1. **`exercise`**
> 2. **prepare `healthy` food**
> 3. get a **full night's `sleep`**
> 4. **`read` a book**
> 5. **`declutter` and `clean`**
> 5. **learn a `language`**
> 6. **learn/practice a `skill`** 
that will get me the **job** I will **_love_ doing**
> 7. spend with all my **`family` and `friends`**
> 8. **meet `new` people**
> 9. try **`new experiences`**
> 9. pursue a **`creative hobby`** that brings me **joy**
> 10. **play a `musical instrument`**
> 11. go **outdoors and enjoy `nature`**
> 12. **`travel`**

... the list of things we _think_ we don't have enough time for is _infinite_. <br />
These are just the ones people most frequently mention.

Even if we don't _say_ the words out loud, 
we have all _thought_ them at some point. <br />
We all forego doing things that we _really_ want/need to do
because we _feel_ like there isn't enough time. <br />

Whatever your mindset regarding the amount of time 
you have available
to do everything you want in life, 
one thing is certain: **without** a **_systematic_ approach**
we are **_all_ ineffective** in how we spend/invest our **time**.

You may have seen the following quote online:

## "_Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. <br />We all have 24-hour days._" ~ [Zig Ziglar](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/270489-lack-of-direction-not-lack-of-time-is-the-problem)

or 

### "_The bad news is time flies. The good news is you‚Äôre the pilot_‚Äù ~ [Michael Altshuler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/144299)

or the most 
[clich√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9) of all:

## "_You have the same number of hours in a day as Beyonce_" ~ [Instagram](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/29)


The problem with these "motivational" quotes
often repeated on social media 
is that they can make us **feel _worse_**
about our time-management - _**self**_ 
"**productivity** [***shaming***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame)" -
and **don't** actually **_help_** us **move _forward_**!
In the case of the one mentioning Beyonce, it's an outright _lie_.
**Queen Bey** has an _army_ of people helping her get the most out of her day.
The rest of us don't have personal assistants and entourages of people
to help us maximise our time. 
The rest of us need a _system_!
<!--
Whenever you hear a self-proclaimed life coach 
or time management guru giving _anyone_ 
advice without providing a system, _run_!
They are just trying to take your money
and make you dependent on them.
You don't need to pay five thousand dollars 
to attend a week-long semminar on time management.
You need a _basic_ 7-step system that works
and you can use for _free_!
-->


Each person has their own _reasons_
for not having enough time,
but the universal fact is that
very few people are living their _best_ life.
For most people it's not their fault.
The existing _systems_ 
for keeping us "on track" are _fundamentally_ broken.
The pull of distraction is overwhelming to most people.

Billions of people have been lured into _burning_ time 
on low-value entertainment activities 
such as watching TV or 
endlessly scrolling through social media apps
instead of working on their personal goals.

> As former Facebook President, 
[Sean Parker](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-react/issues/23#issuecomment-647521076) 
put it: 
Facebook's goal is to <br />
"_consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible_". <br />
> The more time you spend on their platforms
the more money they all make. <br />
They don't care that they are _systematically_
[wasting the lives of millions of people](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/779#issuecomment-625188176).

<!--
> For the single mom with 2 kids and 3 jobs to make ends meet
who doesn't spend a single _second_ on entertainment,
our App will _still_ be able to help!
TODO: Create Persona for this person: https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/213
-->

The _reason_ most people are _ineffective_ at focussing
on tasks that move them toward a specific goal
is that they don't have adequate _systems_
for focussing on what matters 
and maximising personal effectiveness.
Meanwhile the _system_ 
[Mark & Pals](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-react/issues/23) 
have created has an army of 
Social/Computer Science PhDs 
whose job it is to make their time-wasting Apps
as [psychologically addictive](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-to-create-psychological-cravings) 
as possible.
The average person without a systematic approach doesn't stand a _chance_!

### System


## "_You do not rise to the level of your goals. <br /> You fall to the level of your systems._" <br />~ [James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9536717), Atomic Habits


The ***system*** we are building
is designed to help ourselves and others 
move towards our
(life/health/fitness/career/etc.) 
goals is what we are building.
We haven't found a catchy one-line phrase
to summarise the ***system*** we are building. ([`#HelpWanted`]())
Instead we can describe the App as a means 
to answer the following **10 questions**:

1. **What** are my **goals** in life? 
(personal/professional/family/financial/fitness/etc.)
2. Is what I'm doing **right now** 
moving me **towards** one of my **goals**?
3. What is the **highest priority task** 
that I _should_ be working on **right now**?
4. Is the **highest priority task** well defined 
or does it need more detail before I can start on it?
5. What is the **_smallest_ thing** I can **do** 
to **make progress** toward one of my **goals**?
6. Am I **_effectively_ communicating** what I'm working on
with other people so they know when I am **focussing**?
7. Is there anything **requiring my attention right now** 
that **_cannot_ wait** until the end 
of my current highest priority task 
or focus time interval?
8. **Who** in my team/family needs me 
in order to make progress 
on their current (or next) task?
9. Which task on _my_ list **can I _delegate_**
to someone else so that I can focus on 
the item that _only_ I can do.
10. What should I **_avoid_ doing** 
or **say** "**no**" to now
so that I can **focus** on my highest priority item?

<br />

## "_The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything._" ~ [Warren Buffet](https://medium.com/the-ascent/you-can-do-amazing-things-but-only-if-you-have-time-to-do-them-31c07ab5b04e)

What do _you_ need to (_politely and plainly_) say "***no***" to 
so you can **focus** on your **goals**?

## 3 Stages of Our Roadmap


### 1. _Individual_ Person Experience -> [_Single Player_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game)

If the App is not _immediately_ useful to an _individual_ person 
and relies on "network effects" it will be 
[DOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_on_arrival).  <br />
We need to _optimise_ for the individual _first_ 
and then once we are able to use the App individually _ourselves_, 
we can move on to the "Team" experience (see below). 

In the _individual_ person experience, the person uses the dwyl App to:

+ **capture** > **brain-dump** everything they have in their head 
so that they can think clearly (_without a cluttered mind_) and prioritise. üìù 
  
  > Capturing text (_and later voice memos and images_) as "items" 
  which can then be categorised/organised using tags 
  is the most intuitive and versatile way of storing data.
  We only need _one_ field or data type (`text`).
  We can then apply `tags` to an `item` to make it into _anything_ else.
  And then the UI renders the item with the appropriate UX 
  for an `item` with the `tag` `"task"`, displaying a checkbox next to it.

+ define **individual goals** so they can be more systematic about achieving them. 
e.g:
  + **Health**: **exercise** for (at least) **1 minute** each day 
  so I can get/stay fit ‚ù§Ô∏è  
  + **Money**: **save** at least **1%** of my **income** each week/month 
  for a rainy day/retirement üí∞
  + **Family**: spend at least 1 minute of quality time 
  with a family member each day  üíë  
  + **Sleep**: get a _full_ night's restful sleep 
  each night as the foundation for all other goals. üõå 
  + **Career**: practice/learn core work **skill(s)** for **1 minute** 
  each day to achieve mastery. üë©‚Äçüíª 
  + etc ... 
  
  > There are _many_ areas where people can have life goals. 
  Eventually our app will encourage people 
  to have goals defined for each area of a person's life. 
  We will have an on-boarding questionnaire to guide them, 
  a visualisation of "progress" toward each one of the goals 
  and reminders to review them regularly. 
  All features to be added to the backlog and worked on in due course! 
  For now, we need the basic
  [**Personas**](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/213)
  for individuals using the App to guide our discussions.
+ **categorise** the **`items`** (_of **`text`**_) 
they brain-dumped into meaningful categories using `tags`

  > ***Ideally*** people should tie each `item` 
  to a specific goal so that it's clear to them 
  _why_ they need to do something or _why_ 
  a particular `item` of information is _relevant_ to them. 
  > ***However*** we aren't _ever_ going to _force_ 
  any particular "system" on people.
  If someone wants to use our app just 
  to take random  `plaintext` notes that's 100% OK. 
  We will write Blog posts (_product release notes_) 
  for the features we build in the future 
  that will _guide_ people toward having 
  a more systematic approach. 
  e.g: set goals, write everything down, 
  tie all tasks to specific goals, etc. 
  But until we _build_ those features into our App, 
  we _must_ make it _useful_ in `plaintext` mode.


+ ***prioritise*** the `items` that need to be done first,
those that can be differed or delegated.

  > "_If You Don‚Äôt Prioritize Your Life, Someone Else Will_". 
  ~ [Greg McKeown](https://hbr.org/2012/06/how-to-say-no-to-a-controlling), 
  [Essentialism](https://youtu.be/euJc0UmSik8)


+ ***Use*** the App to stay "on track" 
toward _personal_ goals 
and get the most important things done.


<br />

While we feel the _individual_ experience of the App
needs to be flawless as we want anyone 
to be able to use the app in isolation,
we feel the App becomes _exponentially_ more useful/powerful in _teams_.



<br />

### 2. Small _Team_ Experience -> [_Co-op Mode_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_gameplay)
 

We feel that our App will be _incredibly_ helpful
to small "teams" of people who need to collaborate on getting things done.
Small teams will not be limited to "work" colleagues.
Rather we will have personas for families, groups of friends and other associations. 
We will focus on this "team" use-case 
as soon as we have the basic _individual_ UX working.

> If you are keen on helping us with the Colab features,
please take a look at our existing backlog: 
https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues 
If there is a feature you don't see and want to help us describe, 
please open an issue!


### 3. Big Company/Org Experience -> [_MMORPG_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game)!

There is no reason why a "Big" company or organisation cannot use the dwyl App.
But this is not our focus right now. 
We need to crawl, walk & run before we attempt to _fly_. 


<br />

## Basic Workflow

The @dwyl App Will have the following basic workflow:
***Capture, Categorise Complete***.

1. ***Capture*** - capture everything that is on your mind 
in a "brain dump" of one or more `items` of text.
2. ***Categorise*** - split out blocks of text
  into distinct items and _categorise_ them. <br />
  **a)** What type of info/item is it?
  e.g: Todo Item, Reading list item, shopping list,
  random thought, bucket list? <br />
  **b)** Do you have an _existing_ category/tag for the item
  or is it **`new`**? <br />
  **c)** Contextualise the item in terms of time/space:
  a shopping list item context could be "grocery store"
  whereas a reading list item could be "daily commute"<br />
  **d)** **Add** any additional ***detail*** you can think of at the time.
  e.g: acceptance criteria, deadline, dependencies <br />
  **e)** If the item is a task that has sub-tasks, create and link them.
3. ***Complete*** - do the work to _complete_ the item/task.<br />
  **a)** Re-read the original description
  and determine if you have everything you need to start the task.
  If not, write down what is missing. <br />
  **b)** ***Delegate*** if necessary/possible <br />
  **c)** ***Track progress*** of the task. <br />
  **d)** ***Confirm*** it was completed to expected standard. <br />
  **e)** ***Review*** & ***Reflect*** - confirm the task was completed
  and all the original criteria were met by the assignee.
  Leave a brief feedback comment with any thoughts.
  Check the item off as "Done" if appropriate.

For the first step (***Capture***),
we will build an ultra-simple interface
to allow people to
input **`plaintext`**
and save it to a backend as **`text`**
in one or more **`items`**.

For details, please see:
[`brain-dump.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/blob/master/checklists.md)

Once the text input is working,
we will iterate and improve it
in several interesting and innovative ways
in response to feedback from people _using_ the MVP. <br />
We will add additional methods
to help people "capture" information.
e.g:
+ Linking to external sources of information
+ Photo/image uploads
  + Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
  + Image/object recognition
+ Voice/audio recording
  + Speech transcription and indexing

These are complex features
that have formed the basis for entire companies.
So in order to make progress with them,
we will need to _significantly_ leverage
the Open Source work of many brilliant people.
But we are getting ahead of ourselves;
we need to _first_ focus
on creating "MVP" versions
of each step in the workflow.

For the _second_ step, ***Categorise***,
we will need a tagging system that allows people
to apply textual labels to items.
The UX for this is still "TBD".
We will need to sketch it out ahead of sprint planning.
See: https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/235


And finally for the _third_ step, ***Complete***,
we will build a simple checklist system.
See: [`checklists.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/blob/master/checklists.md)

<br />


### USP: What is _different_ about the @dwyl App?

A valid/relevant **question** is: 
what makes the @dwyl App unique?

i.e. What is our
["unique selling point"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition)?<br />
The **answer** is: 
_initially_ it may _appear_ that our App
does not differ much
from existing apps that _partially_ solve 
the personal effectiveness challenge.

The _major_ differences will become apparent in due course:

1. **People Not _Profits_** - We are playing an
["***infinite game***"](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/190)
where our _mission_ is to
"_Empower people to maximise effectiveness, creativity and happiness_."
See:
[What is dwyl's mission?](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/mission.md#what-is-dwyls-mission)
We will not _rest_ until we have created a system/app
that is _universally accessible_ to every human being
that allows _everyone_ a fair opportunity to live their best life.
We will _cooperate_ with _many_ people/organisations
to build a comprehensive solution that _anyone_ can use.

2. ***Open Source*** - All of our code will _always_ be ***Open Source***.
That means anyone can modify/extend/improve it.
And if people feel we are not doing a good enough job
of stewarding the App/community, they can _tell_ us!
Of the _many_ "productivity" apps out there,
almost _none_ are Open Source.
This means that your usage is locked-in to their system for better or worse.
Your data is bound by their "terms and conditions"
(_including being visible to 3<sup>rd</sup> party "analytics" providers
i.e. Google_)
and you are a _hostage_ to their whims.
If they decide to have a UI re-write
that
[_completely_ changes](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/issues/14)
how you interact with the App,
you have _no control_ and are _forced_ to use the "new version";
their way or the highway.
We are going to _eliminate forced updates_
by implementing a UX/UI innovation we call Progressive UI.

3. **Progressive UX/UI** - the UX/UI for _each_ person using the app,
will be _personalised_ to the individual
based on the features they (_most_) _use_.
If the person does not _use_ a particular function, they won't _see_ it.
> Note: This might not feel relevant during "MVP",
but it will be an _amazing_ feature once our app has _lots_ of functionality.

4. **Best-in-Class Engineering Practices** -
Focus on high quality software product
with best-in-class engineering practices.
We are building a robust and reliable app
with a focus on end-to-end testing to ensure a consistent UX
on as many devices as possible.
There shouldn't be any surprises or inconsistent UX (_bugs_),
and if there are, they can be reported and fixed _fast_.


#### Familiar UX?

In some cases the features and UX we are building
may appear _familiar_
because several other people/teams/companies
have _attempted_ to solve this challenge before.
If you are well-versed in _existing_ software/apps
or curious about UI/Design in general,
you _might_ find certain features familiar.
You may think:
"_note-taking similar to Evernote_",
"_collaborative editing like Google Docs_"
or "_offline reading like Pocket_".
In _most_ cases the app(s)
that _already_ has/have a certain feature(s)
(_e.g. nested note-taking, collaborative editing
  or offline distraction-free reading_)
did not _invent_ the feature,
they merely have a memorable _implementation_ of it.
Our intention is _never_ to "copy"
the feature/UX of another App,
but we will draw inspiration from _many_ sources.



# _Who_?

Who is this product roadmap intended for?

+ _Everyone_ ***using*** the dwyl application.
+ _Everyone_ ***contributing*** to
the various project(s) that make up the dwyl app.

<!--
(_provided the **contribution guidelines/workflow** 
is **respected/followed** to **avoid chaos**_).

#### _Who NOT_?

Who should *not* be reading this product roadmap?

Anyone who:
+ believes the World (_or themself_) "_cannot be improved_".

# _When_?

We started a laying the groundwork for
building the dwyl app _while_ ago ... <br />
The app is undergoing constant/ongoing improvement,
we don't expect the app to be "_finished_" because
there are _so many_ useful features we want to build.

_**Get involved today** and **help us prioritize**
which **features** get built **next**_!


# How?

If you want to get involved in helping us with the App,
there are 4 ways to help:

1. **Use** the **_Beta_ App**!
`[insert app link here!]`
2. Give us ***feedback*** on the **_existing_ UX**
`[insert feedback link here!]`
3. **Read** the
[issues](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
and help us answer questions if you can.
4. Write some **`code`**!

### Tech & Features Roadmap

This list _will_ evolve over time. <br />
and check them off this list as we go
We will insert links to specific features

#### MVP Basic Workflow

+ [ ] Mobile First UI/UX to **Capture** **`plaintext`**
  Our _reasoning_ for mobile-first is that
+ [x] Save **`plaintext`** data to Phoenix backend
  see: [dwyl/app/milestone/2](https://github.com/dwyl/app/milestone/2?closed=1)
+ [ ] Simple UX to **Categorise** (Transform)
the **`plaintext`** into actionable items. <br />
UI/UX **`help wanted`**: https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/235
+ [ ] Start working on task (_start timer for item_)
see: https://github.com/nelsonic/time-mvp-phoenix#create-schemas
+ [ ] Check a task off as done.

After the MVP workflow is complete,
we will hold a sprint demo to showcase the state of the App.
The sprint demo will be recorded on our Zoom call.
Following the sprint demo call
we will do a backlog grooming session to discuss the features/ideas list:

#### Offline Support

+ [ ] Create Progressive Web App using Elm.
see: [dwyl/learn-elm#54](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm/issues/54)
and [dwyl/app#254](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/254)
+ [ ] Save data on device if offline.

#### Image Capture



+ [ ] Capture (_upload_) images from mobile+web

+ [ ] Categorise (_tag_) the images for
[findability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability).

#### Authentication

+ [ ] Create accounts to allow people to own their content/items.
+ [ ] Authenticate with GitHub OAuth
  + [ ] Associate person record with GitHub username + token.
+ [ ] Associate **`items`** with **`person`**


### Audit Logging and Record History

+ [ ] We need a way of preserving the history of certain records.
Phoenix does not offer this by default.
The Phoenix "CRUD" _overwrites_ records and **`deletes`** data _permanently_,
this is undesirable if a person ever wants to _undo_ an action.
See: https://github.com/dwyl/postgres-history-spike/issues/1

## Brain Dump of Features

The following list needs to be _organised_:

+ [ ] Security First - ensuring the security of both the people
using the Application(s) and the (_personal_) Data in the system
is a ["hygiene factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
and needs to be addressed _first_ on any checklist.
  + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security
  + https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security

+ [ ] **Offline _First_** - the network might
feel reliable in major Cities, but go outside
in the "wild" it's _consistently unreliable_;
everything we build needs to work offline first
and be _frugal_ with bandwidth.

+ [ ] Mobile First - hopefully this is fairly obvious by now.
  + [ ] Progressive Web App
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-progressive-web-apps
  + [ ] iOS Native App for iDevices (Non-PWA)

  + [ ] Apple Watch UI - while apple watch is _definitely **not**_
  the platform we want to "_win_" the "_wearable tech_"
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-apple-watch-development

+ [ ] Distributed by `default`
  + Blockchain helps us decentralize, verify and secure the database:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-blockchain
  + WebRTC allows peer-to-peer (_decentralised_) communication:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-WebRTC

+ [ ] API: REST and RealTime (WebSockets)

+ [ ] Sharing

+ [ ] Permissions

+ [ ] Teams

+ [ ] Repeatable Checklists

+ [ ] Estimate time required for each task

+ [ ] Delegate task with checklist

+ [ ] Track time against a task

+ [ ] End Task

+ [ ] Get "Sign-off" (_Confirmation_) / Feedback on Completed Task

the App we are building as 
["Productivity"](https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/ios-productivity/id6007),
we don't refer to it as 


## Why Open Source?



## _Public_?

From a "commercial" perspective, making our
Product Roadmap `public` _can_ be viewed as
"_**giving away** all our **secrets**_" by those who follow
_traditional_ (_competition-focussed_) _capitalism_.

We don't think we are "_competing_" with anyone,
rather we are trying to _serve_ the people
using our app and listen to their feedback.
If there are other people/teams/companies
trying to solve the same challenge as us
and they are _not_ open-sourcing their code
and/or guarding the user-feedback,
they are _stuck_ in a _fixed_ mindset.
We believe that _radical_ transparency and openness
both in _what_ we do and _how_ we do it
is _essential_ for succeeding in our _mission_.

Only time will tell if making our product roadmap
Public on GitHub is a good or bad idea, we think it's
worth the _experiment_ just to discover the outcome.

<br />


### Why Do So _Few_ Companies Make Their "Road Map" Public?


_**Most companies**/organisations are
**deliberately** "**guarded**" with
their Product Roadmap for a **number** of **reasons**
that can be summarised as_
["***FUD***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt):

+ _**Fear** that a "**competitor**" will "**steal**" their **ideas**_
(_and get to "**market**" **faster**
thus "capturing" the "**users**" and market share_)

> _**Note**: In **some cases** this **fear**
is **justified** e.g: where an innovation
is easy to replicate and difficult to differentiate.<br />
However we **hypothesize** that
being **open** and **transparent**
with our roadmap will foster
a more **collaborative culture**_.

+ _**Fear** that members of their **own team** will leave
and "**steal**" their **secrets**; <br />
this does
[happen](http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/uber-vs-google-waymo-self-driving-car-wars-get-nasty)
but only because the knowledge is **not** shared openly_.

+ _**Uncertainty** about the **future** of their **product/industry**._ <br />
_Committing to a long-range map implies a fixed/inflexible destination._

+ _**Doubt** in their **own ability** to **deliver** the plan_.

### Final Note

The purpose of this document is to 
share the "Vision" for what we are building.
No map is a _complete_ representation of the world;
it's just a "model" that allows us to think about it.
When you open Google Maps on your phone
it does not show you all the street lights and advertising billboards.
It's the same thing with a Software Product Roadmap.
Including _everything_ would be totally overwhelming to the reader.

Just because a feature is _not_ on this roadmap
does not mean we have not thought of it.
In some cases ideas are only in the Backlog: 
[app/issues](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues) 
and are not reflected here.
In _many_ cases the features/ideas
are added to and discussed on the backlog
and never added to Roadmap because 
they don't _need_ to be on the map.

Our long-term objective is to build a "Platform" for Personal Effectiveness
that _other_ people can add their own features to. 
That is not described here 
because it's too "grandiose" at this stage.
Instead, that part of our long-term vision
is summarised as "API". 
Having a REST+Realtime API will allow
anyone to interact with their data 
and build their own UI/UX.
Building a _Platform_ will allow
any developer/team to build entire features
and make them available to the entire base of people using the @dwyl app.
That's a _much_ bigger undertaking,
which is why we are not discussing 
it until we have traction (10K+ people using the app each day).
