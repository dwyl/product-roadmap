# Product Roadmap

![roadmap-1152x672-flip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/27068309-5b379538-5007-11e7-99fb-20f09369c672.jpg)


## _Why_?

Having a **_clear_ Product Roadmap** is ***essential*** for
ensuring ***everyone*** is ***focussed***
on working towards the collective ***goal***.

### _Public_?

From a "commercial" perspective making our
Product Roadmap `public` _can_ be viewed as
"_**giving away** all our **secrets**_" by those who follow
_traditional_ (_competition-focussed_) "_capitalism_".

We don't think we are "_competing_" with anyone,
rather we are trying to _serve_ the people
using our app and listen to their feedback.

Only time will tell if making our product roadmap
Public on GitHub is a good or bad idea, we think it's
worth the _experiment_ just to discover the outcome.

### Why Do So _Few_ Companies Make Their "Road Map" Public?


_**Most companies**/organisations are
**deliberately** "**guarded**" with
their Product Roadmap for a **number** of **reasons**
that boil down to
["FUD"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)_:

+ _**Fear** that a "**competitor**" will "**steal**" their **ideas**_
(_and get to "**market**" **faster** thus "capturing" the "**users**"_)

> _**Note**: In **some cases** this **fear**
is **justified** e.g: where an innovation
is easy to replicate and difficult to differentiate.<br />
However we **hypothesize** that
being **open** and **transparent**
with our roadmap will foster
a more **collaborative culture**_)

+ _**Fear** that members of their **own team** will leave
and "**steal**" their **secrets**; this happens more
[often](http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/uber-vs-google-waymo-self-driving-car-wars-get-nasty)
people realise_.

+ _**Uncertainty** about the **future** of their **product/industry**_
(_committing to a long-range map implies a fixed/inflexible destination_)

+ _**Doubt** in their **own ability** to **deliver** the plan_.



## _What_?

In "Phase One" of dwyl we are building
a software application to solve a _specific_ set
of ***7 Universal Human Needs***:

1. **Communication**
2. **_Personal_ Time Management**
3. **Teamwork**
4. **Life-long Learning**
5. **Nutrition, Health and Fitness**
6. **Personal Finance Management**
7. [***Self-Actualisation***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization)

> _**Note**: we don't expect **one** app to "**solve**"
all of these problems, and we are **not** going
to "tackle" all the problems at **once**;
we may end up only having time/resources to solve **one**
of these challenges.
This list is intended as a guide not a "gospel"._


## _Who_?

Who is this product roadmap intended for?

+ _Everyone_ ***using*** the dwyl application.
+ _Everyone_ ***contributing*** to
the various project(s) that make up the dwyl app.

(_provided the **contribution guidelines/workflow** is **respected/followed** to **avoid chaos**_).

#### _Who NOT_?

Who should *not* be reading this product roadmap?

Anyone who:
+ believes the World (_or themself_) "_cannot be improved_.
+ thinks the challenges listed above are "_already solved_"
by "XYZ Company" ...
+ is not _obsessed_ by working on solving a
_problem_ that benefits all of humanity.
+ does **not _want_ to _learn_** the skills required
to build something great.
+ is not prepared to
["_**work hard every waking hour**_"](https://youtu.be/NU7W7qe2R0A)

## When?

We started a laying the groundwork for
building the dwyl app _while_ ago ... <br />
The app is undergoing constant/ongoing improvement,
we don't expect the app to be "_finished_" because
there are _so many_ useful features we want to build.

_**Get involved today** and **help us prioritize**
which **features** get built **next**_!

## How?

This list _will_ evolve over time. <br />
We will insert links to specific features
and check them off this list as we go.

+ [ ] Security First - ensuring the security of both the people
using the Application(s) and the (_personal_) Data in the system
is a ["hygiene factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
and needs to be addressed _first_ on any checklist.
  + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security
  + https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security

+ [ ] **Offline _First_** - the network might
feel reliable in major Cities, but go outside
in the "wild" it's _consistenly unreliable_;
everything we build needs to work offline first
and be _frual_ with bandwidth.

+ [ ] Mobile First - hopefully this is fairly obvious by now.
  + [ ] Progressive Web App
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-progressive-web-apps
  + [ ] iOS Native App for iDevices (Non-PWA)

  + [ ] Apple Watch UI - while apple watch is _definately **not**_
  the platform we want to "_win_" the "_wearable tech_"
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-apple-watch-development

+ [ ] Distributed by `default`
  + Blockchain helps us decentralize, verify and secure the database:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-blockchain
  + WebRTC allows peer-to-peer (_decentralised_) communication:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-WebRTC

+ [ ] API: REST and RealTime (WebSockets)

+ [ ] Sharing

+ [ ] Permissions

+ [ ] Teams

+ [ ] Repeatable Checklists

+ [ ] Estimate time required for each task

+ [ ] Delegate task with checklist

+ [ ] Track time against a task

+ [ ] End Task

+ [ ] Get "Sign-off" (_Confirmation_) / Feedback on Completed Task
