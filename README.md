# Product Roadmap

![roadmap-1152x672-flip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/27068309-5b379538-5007-11e7-99fb-20f09369c672.jpg)


## _Why_?

Having a _clear_ **Product Roadmap** is ***essential***
to help ***everyone*** _focus_
on our collective **goal**.

### _Public_?

From a "commercial" perspective making our
Product Roadmap `public` _can_ be viewed as
"_**giving away** all our **secrets**_" by those who follow
_traditional_ (_competition-focussed_) _capitalism_.

We don't think we are "_competing_" with anyone,
rather we are trying to _serve_ the people
using our app and listen to their feedback.
If there are other people/teams/companies
trying to solve the same challenge as us
and they are _not_ open-sourcing their code
and/or guarding the user-feedback,
they are _stuck_ in a _fixed_ mindset.

We believe that _radical_ transparency and openness
both in _what_ we do and _how_ we do it
is _essential_ for succeeding in our _mission_.

Only time will tell if making our product roadmap
Public on GitHub is a good or bad idea, we think it's
worth the _experiment_ just to discover the outcome.

### Why Do So _Few_ Companies Make Their "Road Map" Public?


_**Most companies**/organisations are
**deliberately** "**guarded**" with
their Product Roadmap for a **number** of **reasons**
that all boil down to_
["***FUD***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt):

+ _**Fear** that a "**competitor**" will "**steal**" their **ideas**_
(_and get to "**market**" **faster** thus "capturing" the "**users**"_)

> _**Note**: In **some cases** this **fear**
is **justified** e.g: where an innovation
is easy to replicate and difficult to differentiate.<br />
However we **hypothesize** that
being **open** and **transparent**
with our roadmap will foster
a more **collaborative culture**_)

+ _**Fear** that members of their **own team** will leave
and "**steal**" their **secrets**; this happens more
[often](http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/uber-vs-google-waymo-self-driving-car-wars-get-nasty)
people realise_.

+ _**Uncertainty** about the **future** of their **product/industry**_
(_committing to a long-range map implies a fixed/inflexible destination_)

+ _**Doubt** in their **own ability** to **deliver** the plan_.



## _What_?

In "Phase One" of dwyl we are building
a software application to solve a _specific_ set
of ***7 Universal Human Needs***:

1. **Communication**
2. **_Personal_ Time Management**
3. **Teamwork**
4. **Life-long Learning**
5. **Nutrition, Health and Fitness**
6. **Personal Finance Management**
7. [***Self-Actualisation***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization)

> _**Note**: we don't expect a **single** app to magically "**solve**"
all of these problems, and we are **not** going
to "tackle" all the problems at **once**;
we may end up only having time/resources to solve **one**
of these challenges.
This list is intended as a guide not a "gospel"._


Our immediate plan is to build a **_single_ app**
that satisfies _several_ human needs
by focussing on "***personal effectiveness***".

The App will be a "_hybrid_"
and contain several features
that together help the individual achieve _all_ of their personal goals.
In some cases the features and UX we are building
may appear _familiar_
because several other people/teams/companies
have _attempted_ to solve this challenge before.

###Â USP: What is _different_ about the @dwyl App?

A valid/relevant **question** is: what makes the @dwyl App unique? <br />
The **answer** is: _initially_ it may _appear_ that our App
does not have much different
from existing apps that _partially_ solve the personal effectiveness challenge.
The _major_ differences will become apparent in due course:
1. We are an


The @dwyl App Will have the following workflow:

1. ***Capture*** - capture everything that is on your mind in a "brain dump".
2. ***Categorise*** - split out the text
  into distinct items and _categorise_ them.
  a) What type of info/item is it?
  e.g: Todo Item, Reading list item, shopping list, random thought, bucket list?
  b) Do you have an _existing_ category/tag for the item or is it **`new`**
  c) Add any additional detail you can think of at the time.
3. Complete
  a) Add any relevant detail required to complete the task.
  e.g: acceptance criteria, deadline, dependencies
  b) Delegate if necessary/possible
  c) Track progress of the task
  d) ***Confirm*** it was completed to expected standard.
  e) ***Reflect*** on

  We will build simple UI/UX that helps people
  achieve _all_ of their personal goals:
  Checklists.
  GOTO: [`checklists.md`](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/blob/master/checklists.md)


## _Who_?

Who is this product roadmap intended for?

+ _Everyone_ ***using*** the dwyl application.
+ _Everyone_ ***contributing*** to
the various project(s) that make up the dwyl app.

(_provided the **contribution guidelines/workflow** is **respected/followed** to **avoid chaos**_).

#### _Who NOT_?

Who should *not* be reading this product roadmap?

Anyone who:
+ believes the World (_or themself_) "_cannot be improved_.
+ thinks the challenges listed above are "_already solved_"
by "XYZ Company" ...
+ is not _obsessed_ by working on solving a
_problem_ that benefits all of humanity.
+ does **not _want_ to _learn_** the skills required
to build something great.
+ is not prepared to
["_**work hard every waking hour**_"](https://youtu.be/NU7W7qe2R0A)

## When?

We started a laying the groundwork for
building the dwyl app _while_ ago ... <br />
The app is undergoing constant/ongoing improvement,
we don't expect the app to be "_finished_" because
there are _so many_ useful features we want to build.

_**Get involved today** and **help us prioritize**
which **features** get built **next**_!

## How?

This list _will_ evolve over time. <br />
We will insert links to specific features
and check them off this list as we go.

+ [ ] Security First - ensuring the security of both the people
using the Application(s) and the (_personal_) Data in the system
is a ["hygiene factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
and needs to be addressed _first_ on any checklist.
  + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security
  + https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security

+ [ ] **Offline _First_** - the network might
feel reliable in major Cities, but go outside
in the "wild" it's _consistenly unreliable_;
everything we build needs to work offline first
and be _frual_ with bandwidth.

+ [ ] Mobile First - hopefully this is fairly obvious by now.
  + [ ] Progressive Web App
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-progressive-web-apps
  + [ ] iOS Native App for iDevices (Non-PWA)

  + [ ] Apple Watch UI - while apple watch is _definately **not**_
  the platform we want to "_win_" the "_wearable tech_"
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-apple-watch-development

+ [ ] Distributed by `default`
  + Blockchain helps us decentralize, verify and secure the database:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-blockchain
  + WebRTC allows peer-to-peer (_decentralised_) communication:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-WebRTC

+ [ ] API: REST and RealTime (WebSockets)

+ [ ] Sharing

+ [ ] Permissions

+ [ ] Teams

+ [ ] Repeatable Checklists

+ [ ] Estimate time required for each task

+ [ ] Delegate task with checklist

+ [ ] Track time against a task

+ [ ] End Task

+ [ ] Get "Sign-off" (_Confirmation_) / Feedback on Completed Task
