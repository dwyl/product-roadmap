# Checklists?

A checklist is the most effective way of
keeping track of the list of things to be done
and ensuring that nothing is missed.

or points to be considered, used as a reminder._"

## The Checklist Manifesto

In 2009<sup>1</sup> [Atul Gawande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande)
wrote a _superb_ book titled
[The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto),
which is a _must-read_
for anyone interested in _effectiveness_
both on a _personal_ level and in _any_ field of work.
The concepts in the book are simple,
both to understand and explain;
checklists help us to not forget important steps in tasks.
They dramatically reduce errors (_which all humans are prone to_)
and can be used to safely speed up execution
without loss of quality/effectiveness.

> “_under conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help,
they are required for success._” <br />
~ Atul Gawande, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right

Atul does a excellent job of explaining
how several industries/sectors/professions
develop and use checklists to perform complex high-stakes tasks
precisely, repeatably and virtually error-free.

There are several good reviews/summaries of the book online.
One of my favourite summaries is by Nathan Lorenzo (Productivity Game):

The book details how checklists were developed independently in
several industries:
aviation,
engineering,
construction,
finance,
medicine,
etc.
Without checklists we would not have an aviation industry
with such a high safety track record.
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#Evolution
The same goes for civil engineering where fewer than 1 in 50k
buildings suffer a failure resulting in death.


Ten years later the book remains a "`#1` Best Seller"
in "Hospital Administration",
"Health Care Administration"
and "Family Practice Medicine".

https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000

Those categories might not _immediately_ appeal to _you_,
but consider the fact that the book is "`#954` in Books".
i.e. it's the `#954` most sold book in the _world_.

# _Why?_

## Why does this _matter_?

If it's _obvious_ to you why Atul's book
and checklists in general _matter_,
then feel free to skim/skip this section.
If you found yourself scratching your head
as to _why_ checklists are important,
consider the following recent news article:

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47953541
![bbc-hospital-checklist-article](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/56946829-36448b80-6b23-11e9-9277-a370d4383e20.png)

The BBC News article is not very long, this is the _full_ text:

> Deaths after surgery in Scotland have dropped by more than a third,
research suggests.
A study indicated a 37% decrease since 2008,
which it attributed to the implementation of a safety checklist.
The 19-item list - which was created by the World Health Organization - is supposed to encourage teamwork and communication during operations.
The death rate fell to 0.46 per 100 procedures between 2000 and 2014, analysis of 6.8m operations showed. <br />
Dr Atul Gawande, who introduced the checklist and co-authored the study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, said: "Scotland's health system is to be congratulated for a multi-year effort that has produced some of the largest population-wide reductions in surgical deaths ever documented."
Prof Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director, added: "This is a significant study which highlights the reduction in surgical mortality over the last decade.
"While there are a number of factors that have contributed to this, it is clear from the research that the introduction of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008 has played a key role."

The BBC Article is a very similar to:
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/w-hda041719.php

Sadly while most medical journal articles
are behind _extortionate_
[paywalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall),
the research findings/summary are freely available.
A patient death rate of 0.46% is still not _zero_,
but let's look at how many lives this has saved
just in Scotland:
+ 0.46% x 1.37 = 0.63%
+ 0.63 - 0.46 = 0.17
+ 6.8m x 0.17% = ***11,560 people's lives saved!!***

This is one study in Scotland
which already had good standards
of patient care.
Since the initial checklist was tested
in the pilot study in 2008
it has been rolled out to _thousands_ of hospitals.
_Millions_ of lives have been saved by a humble checklist!
https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/7/08-010708/en

Checklists are as effective at saving lives
as an _wonder drug_ that took _billions_ to develop.
The simplicity is almost

described in the article is this:

> Notice how at the bottom of the single-page checklist it says:
"_This checklist is not intended to be comprehensive.
**Additions and modifications** to fit local practice
are **encouraged**._"
The WHO does not give people the _tools_ to modify the checklist.
See:
https://www.who.int/patientsafety/topics/safe-surgery/checklist/en/
What if it was a _single click_ to "***Customise This Checklist***"
and the UX/UI for doing so was _flawless_ on any device ...?
That is what we are going to achieve.


The BBC article was shared on and reached the _top_ of HackerNews
with over a 1k points
(_that's a lot for such a short and relatively "boring" post_!)

The top comment has an insightful description of checklists:
"_a way to **debug your life**_".

Reading through the comments on HN,
it's clear that _many_ engineers understand the
benefits/power of a checklist in their work/lives,
however there are still a few who remain to be convinced.

Atul's book "The Checklist Manifesto",
is his attempt to make the benefits of checklists
more widespread in more areas of life and society.


A good checklist is:
+ Practical
+ Concise - focus on the important parts of the task
+ Speedy - it should not add "overhead" to the task/activity
+ 5–9 items (_though they can be longer when necessary,
  see WHO checklist below_)
+ 1 page max
+ A clear "Pause Point" where you stop during the completion
+ _Supplement_ existing knowledge and expertise not _replace_ it
+ Uses Upper- & Lowercase
+ _Field-Tested_ in the real world, not theoretical



## Why do _we_ care about checklists?

We care about checklists because
they are the _single_ most effective way of achieving _any_ objective

Anything from giving a housekeeper instructions
for how to use the


## "Old Dogs, New Tricks"

One of the areas I'm _most_ excited about is learning/teaching!



# _What?_

Our mission is simple:
build the simplest possible UI/UX
for creating, sharing and performing repeatable checklists.

And in doing this we will _systematically_:
1. Build a tool that we will use ourselves to:
  1. maximise our _personal_ effectiveness.
  2. optimise the communication in our family, team and community
  by having 100% clarity.
2. Help _everyone_ around the world who wants to achieve the same,
do with minimal effort/overhead while securely storing their data
in a _reliable_ application.
3. Make a sustainable living selling the "Software-as-a-Service"
to people and organisations who want a
"proven system for excellence".


# _How?_

## Basic

We will _start_
by building a _basic_ "Todo List",
we have already written the "beginner-level" example
see: [github.com/dwyl/todo-list-javascript-tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/todo-list-javascript-tutorial)
Our intention with the "Todo List JavaScript (TDD) Tutorial"
is _three_-fold:
1. Show the _general_ developer population,
_both_ complete beginners
and _experienced_ non-testers,
that it's not only _easy_,
but _incredibly_ effective to write tests _first_
(_before implementing the functionality_).
2. Show the _users_ of our App
how a Todo List works from "first principals"
so they can get a _glimpse_
of how much effort it takes
to build a fully-functional
real-time collaborative task tracker.
3. Find people who are similarly _passionate_
about solving the challenge(s)/problem(s)
we are on a mission to solve.

Our _basic_ Todo List

## Paper (Post-it) Prototype

This is the Post-it Prototype of my "Morning Routine" checklist
that I follow each morning:
![nelson-mourning-routine-checklist-postit-prototype-min](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57009925-99045880-6bf1-11e9-97f9-83cad0cfe2aa.JPG)

It has served as an "OK" reminder of the list of things
I do in the morning, but has zero data collection
so I cannot reflect on it.
