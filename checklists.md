# Checklists

## Intro

In 2009<sup>1</sup> [Atul Gawande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande)
wrote a _superb_ book called
[The Checklist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto),
which is a _must-read_
for anyone interested in personal effectiveness.
The concepts in the book are simple,
both to understand and explain.
Atul does a superb job of explaining
how several industries/sectors/professions
use checklists to perform complex high-stakes tasks
precisely, repeatably and virtually error-free.

There are several good reviews/summaries of the book online.
One of my favourite summaries is by Nathan Lorenzo (Productivity Game):

[![checklist-manifesto-summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/56947637-b1a73c80-6b25-11e9-9262-9b1d9e851900.png)](https://youtu.be/18ns58FyPmY)

The book details how checklists were developed independently in
several industries: aviation, engineering/construction, finance,
medicine, etc.

A good checklist is:
+ Practical
+ Concise
+ 5–9 items (_though they can be longer when necessary, see below_)
+ 1 page max
+ Uses Upper- & Lowercase
+ _Tested_ in the real world


Ten years later it remains a "`#1` Best Seller"
in "Hospital Administration",
"Health Care Administration"
and "Family Practice Medicine".

https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000

Those categories might not _immediately_ appeal to _you_,
but consider the fact that the book is "`#954` in Books".
i.e. it's the `#954` most sold book in the _world_.

  Amazon sales

> <sup>1</sup>_**Note**: the book was published in 2009 (as a hardback) but the **paperback** of 2011 is the one that has sold
the numbers_.


# _Why?_

## Why does it _matter_ that this book is so popular?

If it's _obvious_ to you why this book
and checklists in general _matter_,
then feel free to skim/skip this.
If you find yourself scratching your head
as to _why_ this fact is important,
consider the following recent news article:

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47953541
![bbc-hospital-checklist-article](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/56946829-36448b80-6b23-11e9-9277-a370d4383e20.png)

The BBC News article is not very long, this is the _full_ text:

> Deaths after surgery in Scotland have dropped by more than a third,
research suggests.
> A study indicated a 37% decrease since 2008,
which it attributed to the implementation of a safety checklist.
<br />
> The 19-item list - which was created by the World Health Organization - is supposed to encourage teamwork and communication during operations. <br />
> The death rate fell to 0.46 per 100 procedures between 2000 and 2014, analysis of 6.8m operations showed. <br />
> Dr Atul Gawande, who introduced the checklist and co-authored the study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, said: "Scotland's health system is to be congratulated for a multi-year effort that has produced some of the largest population-wide reductions in surgical deaths ever documented." <br />
> Prof Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director, added: "This is a significant study which highlights the reduction in surgical mortality over the last decade. <br />
> "While there are a number of factors that have contributed to this, it is clear from the research that the introduction of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008 has played a key role."
> The BBC Article is a very close copy of:

Sadly most of the journal articles are behind extortionate paywalls.
But the research findings are available.
A patient death rate of 0.46% is still not _zero_,
but let's look at how many lives this has saved:
+ 0.46% x 1.37 = 0.63%
+ 0.63 - 0.46 = 0.17
+ 6.8m x 0.17% = ***11,560 people's lives saved!!***



The 19-item World Health Organization safety checklist
described in the article is this:

> Notice how at the bottom of the single-page checklist it says:
"_This checklist is not intended to be comprehensive.
**Additions and modifications** to fit local practice
are **encouraged**._"
The WHO does not give people the _tools_ to modify the checklist.
See:
https://www.who.int/patientsafety/topics/safe-surgery/checklist/en/
What if it was a _single click_ to "***Customise This Checklist***"
and the UX/UI for doing so was _flawless_ on any device ...?
That is what we are going to achieve.


The BBC article was shared on and reached the _top_ of HackerNews
with over a 1k points
(_that's a lot for such a short and relatively "boring" post_!)

Reading through the comments on HN,
it's clear that _many_ engineers understand the
benefits/power of a checklist in their work/lives,
however there are still a few who remain to be convinced.

## Why do _we_ care about checklists?

We care about checklists because
they are the _single_ most effective way of achieving _any_ objective.




## "Old Dogs, New Tricks"




# _What?_

Our mission is simple:
build the simplest possible UI/UX
for creating, sharing and performing repeatable checklists.

And in doing this we will _systematically_:
1. Build a tool that we will use ourselves to:
  1. maximise our _personal_ effectiveness
  2.
2. Help _everyone_ around the world who wants to achieve the same,
do with minimal effort/overhead while securely storing their data
in a _reliable_ application.
3. Make a sustainable living selling the "Software-as-a-Service"
to people and organisations who want a
"proven system for excellence".


# _How?_

We will _start_
by building a _basic_ "Todo List",
we have already written the "beginner-level" example
see: [github.com/dwyl/todo-list-javascript-tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/todo-list-javascript-tutorial)
Our intention with the "Todo List JavaScript (TDD) Tutorial"
is three-fold:
1. Show the _general_ developer population,
and complete beginners _specificaly_, that it's not only _easy_,
but _incredibly_ effective to write tests _first_.
2.
3.
